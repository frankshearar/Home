Status: **Incubation**

## Issue
The work for this feature and the discussion around the spec is tracked here - **Context aware search and surface project applicability information [#5725](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5725)**

## Problem
As a package consumer:
* I have no way to filter to only those packages that will work with my project.
* When a package fails to install, I don't have a straight-forward way to know why it failed.
* What steps can I take to either install the selected version of a package or find a compatible version of the package.

## Who is the customer?
All NuGet package consumers that use the NuGet package manager UI to manage NuGet packages
