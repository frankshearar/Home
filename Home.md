##Welcome to the NuGet team Wiki.

We plan to use this Wiki for tracking design discussions, for now this is a "playground".

###The intent of this area

We will create design discussion summaries here, for each design discussion we will open a respective *discussion* issue in the new Discussions Milestone. These issues will stay open for a relatively long amount of time, and are for free discussions. They can turn into actionable issues, or remain in discussion state.

Similarly issues raised by the community that don't yet clearly fall into a "Yes we want to try and do it" bucket, will go to the discussions milestone.

###Why are we doing it
It keeps ideas alive and floating around, and doesn't force us to make decisions like we do when we triage issues into milestones. It keeps actual issues we want to execute on short and to the point.
