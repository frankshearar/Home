## Welcome to the NuGet team Wiki

The NuGet Team Wiki will be primarily used for NuGet product specifications.

Product specifications enable the team to put forward ideas, get the discussion going within the team and the community and finally have a well thought out proposal ready for implementation. This will generally only be used by the NuGet team. As always, the community can always open [issues](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues) to put forward their proposals. Provided it aligns with our priorities, roadmap and vision for NuGet, the NuGet team will work with you to formalize that into a product specification. Check this [page](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Writing-and-reviewing-awesome-specs) to get an overview of how to write and review your spec.
