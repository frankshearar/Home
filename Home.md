##Welcome to the NuGet team Wiki

The NuGet Team Wiki will be primarily used for 3 things:-

1. Documenting and updating product roadmap
2. Design meeting notes
3. NuGet product specifications

It keeps ideas alive and floating around, and doesn't force us to make decisions like we do when we triage issues into milestones. It keeps actual issues we want to execute on short and to the point.

### Documenting and updating product roadmap

### Design meeting notes

We will create design discussion summaries herefor each design discussion we will open a respective *discussion* issue in the new Discussions Milestone. These issues will stay open for a relatively long amount of time, and are for free discussions. They can turn into actionable issues, or remain in discussion state.

Similarly issues raised by the community that don't yet clearly fall into a "Yes we want to try and do it" bucket, will go to the discussions milestone.

### NuGet product specifications
