##Welcome to the NuGet team Wiki

The NuGet Team Wiki will be primarily used for 3 things:-

1. Documenting and updating the product roadmap
2. Design meeting notes
3. NuGet product specifications

### Documenting and updating product roadmap
The [product roadmap](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Roadmap) is constantly evolving document that will reflect the team's priorities and the needs of the community for the next one year or so. If you see any items missing that you strongly believe needs to be part of the roadmap, <do this>

### Design meeting notes
We will create design discussion summaries for each design discussion and create a wiki page and a corresponding issue with the _Discussion_ label in the Future milestone. These issues will stay open for a relatively long amount of time, and are for free and open discussion. They can turn into actionable issues, or remain in discussion state.
