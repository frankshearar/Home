## Issue
[Revamped package upload workflow](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5662)

## Problem
NuGet packages undergo several steps such as pre-processing, validation and indexing before they are made available on the gallery and for download from the NuGet.org feed. At present there is no way for the publisher to know what is the status, how much time will it take, or if there is a problem with the package. The NuGet team ends up getting several support requests a day

## Who is the customer?
NuGet package publishers would have an intuitive, self-serve way of knowing the current status of the package and would not have to guess and/or reach out NuGet support.
Fewer tickets for the NuGet team which means we can spend more time doing awesome things.

## Evidence
_What is the evidence that behaves us to act?_
_Evidence can be impassioned tweets or mails, mile long conversations in issues, rants on blogs, sweet sweet data from telemetry!!! If you can show pain, you can rally the troops._

## Solution
_Detailed explanation of the solution. The more pictures/code snippets based on the feature the merrier. Pictures keep folks awake when reading specs._
