# Multiple API Keys

## Problem

Currently, NuGet.org users can only create a Single API key for all their packages. For large GitHub organizations, it is necessary that multiple API keys be created that be scoped to specific actions and packages to prevent a single leak from compromising all the packages. In addition, this enables us to hide the API keys after a one-time generation further reducing the risk and enabling users to create keys with specific privileges.
