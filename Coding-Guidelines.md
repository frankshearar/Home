Let's face it. No matter what coding guidelines we choose, we're not going to make everyone happy. 
In fact, some people out there might be downright angry at the choices we make. 
But the fact of the matter is that there is no "one true bracing style," despite [attempts to name a bracing style as such](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS). 

While we would like to embrace everyone's individual style, working together on the same codebase would be utter chaos 
if we don't enforce some consistency. When it comes to coding guidelines, consistency can be even more important than 
being "right."

## Basics

### Copyright header and license notice

All source code files (mostly `src/**/*.cs` and `test/**/*.cs`) require this exact header (please do not make any changes to it):

```c#
// Copyright (c) .NET Foundation. All rights reserved.
// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. See License.txt in the project root for license information.
```

It is ok to skip it on generated files, such as `*.designer.cs`.

Every repo also needs the Apache 2.0 License in a file called LICENSE.txt in the root of the repo. Please use only identical copies to what we have in other repos.

(There are some exceptions to this, but they need to be approved by @eilon.)

### Code reviews and checkins

To help ensure that only the highest quality code makes its way into the project, please submit all your code changes to GitHub as PRs. This includes Visual Studio extension, gallery and command line code changes, unit test updates, and updates to official samples. For example, sending a PR for just an update to a unit test might seem like a waste of time but the unit tests are just as important as the product code and as such, reviewing changes to them is also just as important.

The advantages are numerous: improving code quality, more visibility on changes and their potential impact, avoiding duplication of effort, and creating general awareness of progress being made in various areas.

In general a PR should be signed off (using the :shipit: `:shipit:` emoticon) by the Subject Matter Expert (SME) of that code. For example, a change to the Banana project should be signed off by `@MrMonkey`, and not by `@MrsGiraffe`. If you don't know the SME, please talk to one of the engineering leads and they will be happy to help you identify the SME. Of course, sometimes it's the SME who is making a change, in which case a secondary person will have to sign off on the change (e.g. `@JuniorMonkey`).

To commit the PR to the repo **do not use the Big Green Button**. Instead, do a typical push that you would use with Git (e.g. local pull, rebase, merge, push).

## Source code management

The *structure* of the code that we write and the *tools* that we use to write the code.

### Repos

To create a new repo in the https://github.com/nuget/ org, contact @yishaigalatzer.

### Home repo

The https://github.com/nuget/Home repo is the starting point for all things NuGet. It has the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) as well as an [up-to-date README](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/blob/master/README.md) of how repos are structured. Make sure to consult it before beginning your journey through NuGet code.

### Branch strategy

In general:

* `master` has the code for the latest release of NuGet (e.g. alpha, beta, RC, RTM)
* `dev` has the code that is being worked on but not yet released. This is the branch into which devs normally submit pull requests and merge changes into.
* `release` has the code that is being staged and stabilized for an upcoming release

Shortly before a release, the `release` branches are created from `dev`, and stabilization work happens there. Post-release work continus in the `dev` branch. Once the release takes place, the code is pushed from `release` to `master`.

### Solution and project folder structure and naming

Solution files generally go in the repo root.

Solution names match repo names (e.g. NuGet.sln in the NuGet repo).

Every project also needs a `project.json` and a matching `.xproj` file. This `project.json` is the source of truth for a project's dependencies and configuration options.

Solutions need to contain solution folders that match the physical folders (`src`, `test`, etc.).

For example, in the `Fruit` repo with the `Banana` and `Lychee` projects you would have these files checked in:

```
/Fruit.sln
/src
/src/NuGet.Banana
/src/NuGet.Banana/project.json
/src/NuGet.Banana/Banana.kproj
/src/NuGet.Banana/Banana.cs
/src/NuGet.Banana/Util/BananaUtil.cs
/src/NuGet.Lychee
/src/NuGet.Lychee/project.json
/src/NuGet.Lychee/Lychee.kproj
/src/NuGet.Lychee/Lychee.cs
/src/NuGet.Lychee/Util/LycheeUtil.cs
/test
/test/NuGet.Banana.Tests
/test/NuGet.Banana.Tests/project.json
/test/NuGet.Banana.Tests/BananaTest.kproj
/test/NuGet.Banana.Tests/BananaTest.cs
/test/NuGet.Banana.Tests/Util/BananaUtilTest.cs
```

Note that after running the `build` command the system will generate the following files:

```
/build/*.shade
```

All these files are set to be ignored in the `.gitignore` file.

### Conditional compilation for Desktop/CoreCLR

Almost all development is done for both CoreCLR and Desktop .NET. Some code will be CoreCLR-specific or Desktop-specific because of API changes or behavior differences. The build system has two conditional compilation statements to assist with this:

Desktop:

```c#
#ifdef DNX451
```

or, depending on exact target:

```c#
#ifdef NET451
```

CoreCLR:

```c#
#ifdef DNXCORE50
```

### Assembly naming pattern

The general naming pattern is `NuGet.<area>.<subarea>`.

### Build system

Starting with NuGet v3, we are using a new system called KoreBuild, which is built using the sake build tools. The sake project is available here: https://github.com/sakeproject/sake

### Unit tests

We use xUnit.net for all unit testing.

### Repo-specific Samples

Some repos will have their own sample projects that are used for testing purposes and experimentation. Please ensure that these go in a `samples/` sub-folder in the repo.

To have a sample project reference a project in `src` you'll need a `global.json` file in the root of your repo. By default project-to-project references must be sibling folders. Using a `global.json` file allows a solution to specify non-standard locations to locate references. The format of `global.json` is as follows:

```json
{
    "sources": ["src"]
}
```

## Coding guidelines

The *content* of the code that we write.

### Coding style guidelines â€“ general

The most general guideline is that we use all the VS default settings in terms of code formatting, except that we put `System` namespaces before other namespaces (this used to be the default in VS, but it changed in a more recent version of VS).

1. Use four spaces of indentation (no tabs)
2. Use `_camelCase` for private members
3. Avoid `this.` unless absolutely necessary
4. Always specify member visiblity, even if it's the default (i.e. `private string _foo;` not `string _foo;`)

### Usage of the var keyword

The `var` keyword is to be used as much as the compiler will allow. For example, these are correct:

```c#
var fruit = "Lychee";
var fruits = new List<Fruit>();
var flavor = fruit.GetFlavor();
string fruit = null; // can't use "var" because the type isn't known (though you could do (string)null, don't!)
const string expectedName = "name"; // can't use "var" with const
```

The following are incorrect:

```c#
string fruit = "Lychee";
List<Fruit> fruits = new List<Fruit>();
FruitFlavor flavor = fruit.GetFlavor();
```

### Use C# type keywords in favor of .NET type names

When using a type that has a C# keyword the keyword is used in favor of the .NET type name. For example, these are correct:

```c#
public string TrimString(string s) {
    return string.IsNullOrEmpty(s)
        ? null
        : s.Trim();
}

var intTypeName = nameof(Int32); // can't use C# type keywords with nameof
```

The following are incorrect:

```c#
public String TrimString(String s) {
    return String.IsNullOrEmpty(s)
        ? null
        : s.Trim();
}
```

### When to use internals vs. public and when to use InternalsVisibleTo

Usage of internal types and members is allowed, but discouraged.

`InternalsVisibleTo` is used only to allow a unit test to test internal types and members of its runtime assembly. We do not use `InternalsVisibleTo` between two runtime assemblies.

If two runtime assemblies need to share common helpers then we will use a "shared source" solution with build-time only packages. 

If two runtime assemblies need to call each other's APIs, the APIs must be public. If we need it, it is likely that our customers need it.

### Argument null checking

Null checking is required for parameters that cannot be null (big surprise!). To add null checking to your code, declare this attribute in your assembly in any namespace (use the JetBrains namespace to have ReSharper work):

```c#
using System;

namespace JetBrains.Annotations
{
    [AttributeUsage(
        AttributeTargets.Method | AttributeTargets.Parameter |
        AttributeTargets.Property | AttributeTargets.Delegate |
        AttributeTargets.Field, AllowMultiple = false, Inherited = true)]
    internal sealed class NotNullAttribute : Attribute
    {
    }
}
```

And then annotate parameters of methods or property setters:

```c#
public void GetBanana([NotNull] string variety)
{
    // do not do explicit null check in the method body!
    ...
}

public string Variety
{
    get;
    [param: NotNull]
    set;
}
```

The null checking code will be code-gen'ed at compile time into the method body.

#### Argument null checking in interface member definitions and abstract/virtual methods

If an interface member or abstract/virtual member contractually disallows nulls in its parameters, annotate them with `[NotNull]`.
The implementing method does *not* need the annotations - the code-gen will automatically emit the null checking code on the implementing method.

#### Argument null checking in chained constructors/methods

Null checks should be used on any public entry point where null is not allowed. This ensures the contract of not-nullable is seen by all callers.

```c#
public class Banana
{
    // Even though all this ctor does is chain the next ctor, it still must have NotNull annotations
    public Banana([NotNull] string name, [NotNull] string variety)
        : this(name, variety, string.Empty)
    {
    }

    public Banana([NotNull] string name, [NotNull] string variety, [NotNull] string color)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Async method patterns

By default all async methods must have the `Async` suffix. There are some exceptional circumstances where a method name from a previous framework will be grandfathered in.

Passing cancellation tokens is done with an optional parameter with a value of `default(CancellationToken)`, which is equivalent to `CancellationToken.None` (one of the few places that we use optional parameters).

Sample async method:

```c#
public Task GetDataAsync(
    QueryParams query,
    int maxData,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken))
{
    ...
}
```

### Extension method patterns

The general rule is: if a regular static method would suffice, avoid extension methods.

Extension methods are often useful to create chainable method calls, for example, when constructing complex objects, or creating queries.

Internal extension methods are allowed, but bear in mind the previous guideline: ask yourself if an extension method is truly the most appropriate pattern.

The namespace of the extension method class should generally be the namespace that represents the functionality of the extension method, as opposed to the namespace of the target type.

The class name of an extension method container (also known as a "sponsor type") should generally follow the pattern of `<Feature>Extensions`, `<Target><Feature>Extensions`, or `<Feature><Target>Extensions`. For example:

```c#
namespace Food {
    class Fruit { ... }
}
namespace Fruit.Eating {
    class FruitExtensions { public static void Eat(this Fruit fruit); }
  OR
    class FruitEatingExtensions { public static void Eat(this Fruit fruit); }
  OR
    class EatingFruitExtensions { public static void Eat(this Fruit fruit); }
}
```

When writing extension methods for an interface the sponsor type name must not start with an `I`.

### Doc comments

The person writing the code will write the doc comments. Public APIs only. No need for doc comments on non-public types.

Note: Public means callable by a customer, so it includes protected APIs. However, some public APIs might still be "for internal use only" but need to be public for technical reasons. We will still have doc comments for these APIs but they will be documented as appropriate.

### Assertions

Use `Debug.Assert()` to assert a condition in the code. Do not use Code Contracts (e.g. `Contract.Assert`).

Please note that assertions are only for our own internal debugging purposes. They do not end up in the released code, so to alert a developer of a condition use an exception.

### Unit tests and functional tests

#### Assembly naming

The unit tests for the `NuGet.Fruit` assembly live in the `NuGet.Fruit.Tests` assembly.

The functional tests for the `NuGet.Fruit` assembly live in the `NuGet.Fruit.FunctionalTests` assembly.

In general there should be exactly one unit test assembly for each product runtime assembly. In general there should be one functional test assembly per repo. Exceptions can be made for both.

#### Unit test class naming

Test class names end with `Test` and live in the same namespace as the class being tested. For example, the unit tests for the `NuGet.Fruit.Banana` class would be in a `NuGet.Fruit.BananaTest` class in the test assembly.

#### Unit test method naming

Unit test method names must be descriptive about *what is being tested*, *under what conditions*, and *what the expectations are*. Pascal casing and underscores can be used to improve readability. The following test names are correct:

```
PublicApiArgumentsShouldHaveNotNullAnnotation
Public_api_arguments_should_have_not_null_annotation
```

The following test names are incorrect:

```
Test1
Constructor
FormatString
GetData
```

#### Unit test structure

The contents of every unit test should be split into three distinct stages, optionally separated by these comments:

```c#
// Arrange  
// Act  
// Assert 
```

The crucial thing here is that the `Act` stage is exactly one statement. That one statement is nothing more than a call to the one method that you are trying to test. Keeping that one statement as simple as possible is also very important. For example, this is not ideal:

```c#
int result = myObj.CallSomeMethod(GetComplexParam1(), GetComplexParam2(), GetComplexParam3());
```

This style is not recommended because way too many things can go wrong in this one statement. All the `GetComplexParamN()` calls can throw for a variety of reasons unrelated to the test itself. It is thus unclear to someone running into a problem why the failure occurred.

The ideal pattern is to move the complex parameter building into the `Arrange` section:

```c#
// Arrange
P1 p1 = GetComplexParam1();
P2 p2 = GetComplexParam2();
P3 p3 = GetComplexParam3();

// Act
int result = myObj.CallSomeMethod(p1, p2, p3);

// Assert
Assert.AreEqual(1234, result);
```

Now the only reason the line with `CallSomeMethod()` can fail is if the method itself blew up. This is especially important when you're using helpers such as `ExceptionHelper`, where the delegate you pass into it must fail for exactly one reason.


### Testing exception messages

In general testing the specific exception message in a unit test is important. This ensures that the exact desired exception is what is being tested rather than a different exception of the same type. In order to verify the exact exception it is important to verify the message.

To make writing unit tests easier it is recommended to compare the error message to the RESX resource. However, comparing against a string literal is also permitted.

```c#
var ex = Assert.Throws<InvalidOperationException>(
    () => fruitBasket.GetBananaById(1234));
Assert.Equal(
    Strings.FormatInvalidBananaID(1234),
    ex.Message);
```

#### Use xUnit.net's plethora of built-in assertions

xUnit.net includes many kinds of assertions â€“ please use the most appropriate one for your test. This will make the tests a lot more readable and also allow the test runner report the best possible errors (whether it's local or the CI machine). For example, these are bad:

```c#
Assert.Equal(true, someBool);

Assert.True("abc123" == someString);

Assert.True(list1.Length == list2.Length);

for (int i = 0; i < list1.Length; i++) {
    Assert.True(
        String.Equals
            list1[i],
            list2[i],
            StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
}
```

These are good:

```c#
Assert.True(someBool);

Assert.Equal("abc123", someString);

// built-in collection assertions!
Assert.Equal(list1, list2, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
```

#### Parallel tests

By default all unit test assemblies should run in parallel mode, which is the default. Unit tests shouldn't depend on any shared state, and so should generally be runnable in parallel. If the tests fail in parallel, the first thing to do is to figure out *why*; do not just disable parallel tests!

For functional tests it is reasonable to disable parallel tests.

### Use only complete words or common/standard abbreviations in public APIs

Public namespaces, type names, member names, and parameter names must use complete words or common/standard abbreviations.

These are correct:
```c#
public void AddReference(AssemblyReference reference);
public EcmaScriptObject SomeObject { get; }
```

These are incorrect:
```c#
public void AddRef(AssemblyReference ref);
public EcmaScriptObject SomeObj { get; }
```

## Product planning and issue tracking

How we track what work there is to do.

### Issue tracking

Bug management takes place in GitHub. For the NuGet.org website, we track issues in the [NuGet Gallery Issue Tracker](https://github.com/nuget/NuGetGallery/issues). NuGet client tools (the Visual Studio extension, NuGet.exe command line tool, etc.) issues are tracked in [NuGet Home](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues).

Bugs cannot be moved between repos so make sure you open a bug in the right repo. If a bug is opened in the wrong repo someone will have to manually copy it to the correct repo.

## Tips and tricks

The *structure* of the code that we write and the *tools* that we use to write the code.

### GitHub Flavored Markdown

GitHub supports Markdown in many places throughout the system (issues, comments, etc.). However, there are a few differences from regular Markdown that are described here:

	https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown

### Including people in a GitHub discussion

To include another team member in a discussion on GitHub you can use an `@ mention` to cause a notification to be sent to that person. This will automatically send a notification email to that person (assuming they have not altered their GitHub account settings). For example, in a PR's discussion thread or in an issue tracker comment you can type `@username` to have them receive a notification. This is useful when you want to "include" someone in a code review in a PR, or if you want to get another opinion on an issue in the issue tracker.

Do not just assume people will see an issue or discussion and make sure to mention people who need to see it.

### Local debugging of cross-repo dependencies

If you're making lots of changes to projects that have a cross-repo dependency you might find that using `build install` to create a NuGet package each time is too time-consuming. An alternative is to use a `global.json` file to specify that project references can be found in another folder on disk. Add a file called `global.json` to the root of the repo you are working in and use the following syntax:

```json
{
    "sources": ["src", "../DependencyInjection/src"]
}
```

Then you can run projects more easily in VS, debug more easily, test more quickly, and also write code and refactor more quickly.

### Editing Sake files (`*.shade`)

To more easily edit Sake files (`*.shade`) check out the [Sublime-Sake package](https://github.com/anurse/Sublime-Sake) for Sublime Text.

### ReSharper

Many repos have a `<solution>.sln.DotSettings` file. This is a ReSharper solution settings file that automatically applies correct file headers and code style described in this document.

A code cleanup profile named "NuGet" is also included in this solution settings file. It applies the aforementioned code guidelines. It does not do a code format as in some places developers are smarter than tools.
