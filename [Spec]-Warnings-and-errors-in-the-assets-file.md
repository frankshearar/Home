Restore and Build generate duplicate warnings and errors in some scenarios. To improve this restore should log messages to the assets file where they can be de-duplicated with build.

Adding messages to the assets file also improves the scenario where a user builds in a different session, possibly days after doing the restore. If the restore failed build could display the original failure messages from restore to help the user debug the problem.

## Reading log messages example

```cs
var reader = new LockFileFormat();
var assetsFile = reader.Read("c:\myproject\obj\project.assets.json");

foreach (var log in assetsFile.LogMessages)
{
  Console.WriteLine($"{log.Code}: {log.Message}");
}
```


## Log message interface

```cs
    public interface IAssetsLogMessage
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Level to indicate if this is an error or wanring.
        /// </summary>
        LogLevel Level { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Indicates the NuGet error code.
        /// </summary>
        NuGetLogCode Code { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Indicates the staring generated by the code to go with the error code.
        /// </summary>
        string Message { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Indicates the date time at which the error occurred.
        /// </summary>
        DateTimeOffset Time { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Indicates the project for which the error was thrown.
        /// </summary>
        string ProjectPath { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Level to indicate the warning level for the message.
        /// This is relevant only if the Level == LogLevel.Warning.
        /// </summary>
        WarningLevel WarningLevel { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Indicates the file for which the error was thrown.
        /// </summary>
        string FilePath { get; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Indicates the starting line for which the error was thrown.
        /// </summary>
        int StartLineNumber { get; set; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Indicates the starting column for which the error was thrown.
        /// </summary>
        int StartColumnNumber { get; set; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Indicates the ending line for which the error was thrown.
        /// </summary>
        int EndLineNumber { get; set; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Indicates the ending column for which the error was thrown.
        /// </summary>
        int EndColumnNumber { get; set; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Project or Package Id
        /// </summary>
        string LibraryId { get; set; }

        /// <summary>
        /// List of TargetGraphs
        /// </summary>
        IReadOnlyList<string> TargetGraphs { get; set; }
    }
```


## Assets file example
```json
{
  "logs": [
    {
      "code": "NU1000",
      "level": "Error",
      "filePath": "kung\\fu\\fighting.targets",
      "startLineNumber": 11,
      "startColumnNumber": 2,
      "endLineNumber": 10,
      "message": "test log message",
      "targetGraph": [
        "net46",
        "netcoreapp1.0",
        "netstandard1.6"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Helper methods

```cs
/// <summary>
/// Get target graphs for the current log message.
/// </summary>
public static IEnumerable<LockFileTarget> GetTargetGraphs(this IAssetsLogMessage message, LockFile assetsFile);

/// <summary>
/// Get the library from each target graph it exists in.
/// </summary>
public static IEnumerable<LockFileTargetLibrary> GetTargetLibraries(this IAssetsLogMessage message, LockFile assetsFile);

/// <summary>
/// Get the library by id from the target graph.
/// </summary>
public static LockFileTargetLibrary GetTargetLibrary(this LockFileTarget target, string libraryId);
```
