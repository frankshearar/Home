Status: **Incubation**

## Issue
The work for this feature and the discussion around the spec is tracked here - **Improve NuGet package debugging and symbols experience [#6104](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6104)**

##  Problem
Today the NuGet package debugging story requires many steps and doesn't support the full gamut of .NET development scenarios. Both the author and consumer experience require extra steps, and there is not yet support for the new portable PDB format. 

## Who is the customer?
NuGet package authors and package consumers

## Solution

** Coming soon **
