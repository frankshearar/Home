##  Problem
Today there is no self-service option for a user to delete his/her NuGet account. Even if we do a get a genuine request to delete an account, we donâ€™t have a way to do it since that would result in the orphaned packages.

## Who is the customer?
Any person or entity which has registered and has a nuget.org account.

## Evidence
The volume of account deletion requests is showing an upward trend. We have received 5 requests in the past 30 days. Also, to adhere to privacy laws we must allow the user to delete all personal information including their account.
