Status: **Incubation**

## Issue
The work for this feature and the discussion around the spec is tracked here - **Context aware search and surface project applicability information [#5725](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5725)**

## Problem
When a user searches for a package either in a NuGet client or on NuGet.org, we list packages that are often not relevant in the context of the user project. 

## Who is the customer?
All NuGet package consumers

## Solution
More info coming soon.
