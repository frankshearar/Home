## Issue

The investigation started with [#3788](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/3788), but is related to [#5714](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5714) for enhancing the update package experience.

## Problem

The package manager client inside visual studio has no support for floating versions in the UI. If a user uses a floating version in any of the packages (e.g. `10.0.*`) the UI will take the minimum version possible for the range (e.g. `10.0.0`) and show it as if it is installed, even though the actual resolved version could be different. In the following example, the package reference specifies `3.7.*`, and the resolved version (found in the assets file) is `3.7.1`, nevertheless the UI shows that the installed version is `3.7.0` which is misleading.

This scenario can also be problematic if the calculated version doesn't exist, because neither the list item nor the detail control will display the correct metadata for the package. In the example below the specified version was `10.0.*` and it was resolved to `10.0.3`, but version `10.0.0` doesn't exist for this package.

When using floating versions, the restore command should update the package if a new version inside of the proposed range is available. **Should the manager UI treat a new version inside the floating range as a regular update?**. The following scenarios where identified as relevant to take into account in the proposed solution.

### Scenarios

- The latest version falls inside floating range and the resolved version is the same as the latest.
- The latest version falls inside floating range and the resolved version is older than the latest.
- The latest version doesn't fall inside floating range but the resolved version is max of the range.
- The latest version doesn't fall inside floating range but the resolved version is not the max of range.

## Solution

The current behavior of this client for non-floating versions is to use the version installed as a reference in the list item and the detail view for each dependency.

The updates are always suggested based on this installed/resolved version.

The proposed solution involves updating the client to get the actual resolved version for each package from the assets file instead of calculating the minimum version, therefore showing the actual version installed for packages with floating versions. This solution leaves some questions open about how to handle updates in packages with a floating version.

As [@joelverhagen](https://github.com/joelverhagen)Â proposed in [#5714](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5714) there are different scenarios for updating a package and each of them has a different urgency. NuGet Client should provide different signals to show different types of updates. To clarify what each signal means a tooltip message can be provided. 

The behavior proposed for each of the different scenarios is:

### Latest version falls inside floating range and resolved version is the same as the latest

The user has the latest version, the client should treat this in the UI the same way as if the user had directly installed the latest version.

### Latest version falls inside floating range and resolved version is older than latest

Show another icon for update (e.g. green up arrow) and specify in a tooltip that an update is available by doing a restore, but don't show it NuGet's updates tab.

### Latest version doesn't fall inside floating range but resolved version is max of the range

Show the update to the user the same way as we show updates right now in the client UI. The user can then decide if they want to update to a new version and have NuGet update the package reference to reflect this action.

### Latest version doesn't fall inside floating range but resolved version is not the max of range

Show only one of the types of update (either update by restoring or update by UI). **Which one is more important?**


_For all scenarios the version on the right in the list item, the version on the "Installed" section of the detail view and the bold version of the "version" dropdown in the detail view should show the actual version resolved, not a minimum calculated by the client._

## Open Questions
- Should we show an update when there is a new version inside the floating range and the user hasn't ran restore?
- Should we shown an update for a latest version outside of the floating range?
- How can we let the user know they're using a floating version but also indicate them which version the package resolved to?
- How are we going to manage updates? Right now we run the update and then rewrite the references to show the current installed version, in the case of floating ranges we don't want to overwrite the references because they might fall in that same range.
- Do we want to have a way to let the user specify an installation with floating version from the UI?
