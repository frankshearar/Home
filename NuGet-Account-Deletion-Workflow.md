## Issue
The work for this feature and the discussion around the spec is tracked here - **Enable NuGet Account Deletion workflow [#3204](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/3204)**


##  Problem
Today there is no option for a user to delete their NuGet account. If we get a valid request to delete an account, we donâ€™t have a workflow to do it.

## Who is the customer?
Any person or entity which has registered and has a NuGet.org account.

## Solution



### Contact Us Page
We will update the contact us page with details around Deleted user contact. i.e. the NuGet team will only respond to copyright license issues and we do not support individual packages.

### Duplicate account username check
Usernames of all deleted account will be reserved and new accounts with the same username cannot be created.

### SLA
As a matter of policy, we will commit to a 5 business day time-frame to action the request.
