# UI Design meeting notes

We have gotten feedback about the NuGet UI, and decided to address it in two steps.

Step 1. Perform relatively small/manageable changes to the UI to address the bulk of the feedback, but not necessarily overhaul it or add new features
Step 2. Perform another design iteration to address further feedback, and start incorporating feature requests.

Given the amount of user scenarios, and the variety of user scenarios this will be a series of design discussions where we are going to gradually refine the design.

We met on Aug 20th and 21st, and came up with initial suggestion for updates two pieces of the manage packages for solution and manage packages for project UI.

###Top bar
In the first meeting we focused on the top bar, this is what it looks like in NuGet 3.1.1

The feedback revolved around the fact that the dropdown filter was confusing, search was forced and was churning out requests, some people wanted to go straight to their installed packages.

We came up with the following sketch as a starting point for a more detailed design
